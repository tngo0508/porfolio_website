I graduated from the California State University, Fullerton (CSUF) in 2017, where my solid state chemistry research was on unconventional oxide perovskites. I am currently a graduate student in the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University. My research focuses on the synthesis and magnetic properties of hexagonal perovskites. I have discovered several new face-sharing hexagonal perovskites, several of which potentially host a quantum spin liquid state. My goal is to discover interesting properties in both known and new semiconducting perovskite compounds for better material applications.
