          <p>
            I graduated from the California State University, Fullerton (CSUF)
            in 2017, where my solid state chemistry research was on
            unconventional oxide perovskites. I am currently a graduate student
            in the Department of Chemistry at Princeton University. My research
            focuses on the synthesis and magnetic properties of hexagonal
            perovskites. I have discovered several new face-sharing hexagonal
            perovskites, several of which potentially host a quantum spin liquid
            state. My goal is to discover interesting properties in both known
            and new semiconducting perovskite compounds for better material
            applications.

          <p>
            My solid state chemistry research was on unconventional oxide
            perovskites. The key point to understand the relationship between
            structures and properties is to accurately determine the crystal
            structures of the materials. My work was to synthesize and probe the
            structure-property relations on perovskites by X-ray and neutron
            diffractions and the Physical Property Measurement System. My
            undergraduate advisor and I developed the criteria for forming
            non-cooperative octahedral tilted (NCOT) perovskites, where the
            materials break the conventional corner-sharing octahedral fashion.
